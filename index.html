                Directed by F.W. Murnau, Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans premiered in 1927 starring George O'Brien as The Man and Janet Gaynor as The Wife. The film centers around a couple who are shown living happily in the country with their baby at the start of the film. A wicked city woman comes to town and seduces the husband. She convinces him to drown his wife so that they can run away together. He almost goes through with the deed but his wife runs away to the city. 
                    After finding her, the two rekindle their love of one another during their day exploring the city. On their way back home, there is a storm and the wife is thrown overboard. The husband rouses a search party to look for her and the wicked city woman is thrilled, thinking she is dead.
                    The husband sends her away and eventually his wife is found.

                <h3>What Critics Thought</h3>
               <p>
                    Mordaunt Hall proclaimed that Sunrise was a "A Film Masterpiece" in the "New York Times" while "Time" Magazine called the story  "meagre" yet overall "picturesquely soporific" (which I'll admit I had to look up and it means inducing drowsiness or sleep). 
                    Regardless, Sunrise has grown the reputation for being historically and culturally important as well as one of the most impressive films of its era.
