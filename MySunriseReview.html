        <h1> Sunrise Review</h1>
     
            <p class="notebook">
           I chose "Sunrise" as the subject for this website because it recently came into public domain and also stars one of my favorite Old Hollywood actresses, Janet Gaynor. I was impressed with the technical aspects and performances in "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans". There were some beautiful wide nature shots in contrast to the superimposition and forced perspective 
           utilized to give the city an oppressive, and unsettling feel. The camera movement and tracking shots were also beautifully exectured- its interesting to think of how this expressive camera movement would be rendered 
           impossible a few short years after this film was made with the advent of sound. Thematically I have some pretty big issues with this movie being 
           portrayed as a touching story of reconnection between a husband and a wife given that he tries to murder her and then gain her trust back all in 24 hours. I guess I have to chalk that up to the genre of 
           melodrama and early 20th century ideas regarding womens rights and marriage. Even their character names: The Man and The Wife illuminate the dehumanizing gender double standard projected onto women at the time. On the surface its a beautiful and touching film,,, unless you spend too long thinking about it. As I mentioned earlier, though I may be biased,
           I was truly impressed with the moving and honest performances by George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor in this film. I think movies are too ironic and cynical now and its so refreshing to see such sincerity and strength of emotion portrayed (with the exception of the whole fighting for her life during attempted murder thing). <br> 
           I have often toyed with the idea of creating an anonymous film critiquing website and this website may have inspired me to potentially take a stab at it. I had a lot of fun designing this website- its not something I ever imagined I would do but I'm so glad I had the opportunity! <br>
           That's basically all I have for now except to say this movie is definitely worth watching and I would recommend checking out some older and/or silent movies because they can be pretty cool! And many are accessible through tubi, youtube, and your local library dvds.
