            <p class="testimonials">
             The awards were held as a private industry dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, California. Tickets cost $5 (about $89 today) and 270 people attended. The ceremony was just 15 minutes long and is the only Academy Awards that was not broadcast or televised in any way. However, many fans crowded outside the hotel to catch a glimpse of stars as they entered.
